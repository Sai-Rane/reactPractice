Redux is a library for Javascript Applications
You can use Redux together with React or with any other view library i.e Angular or Vue is a state container ex:Registration form

----------------------------------------------------------

Core Concepts of Redux:

Keep these 3 things in mind 
Store - Holds state of your Application
Action - Describe the changes in state of Application
Reducer - Actually carries out the state transition depending on the action. Reducer is a function

Example:             Book Shop
         Shop <-------> Shopkeeper <-------> Customer
        (store)         (Reducer)            (Action)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rule of Redux:

1. The state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store
{
    NumberOfBooks:10
}

2. Only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened
{
    Type:"buyCake",
    Type:"Increment Operation"
}

3. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, we write pure Reducer
