In Routes tag we put all our Route tags.
In Route tag we have 2 attribute/properties such as path and element
In path we write the directions and in element we specify the destination

Example:
import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";

  <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<div>I am home page</div>} />
    </Routes>

Link Tag:
Whatever we write in Link tag will become clickable.
Link also has a to property in which we specify the path

useNavigation hook - Used to navigate from one page to another

How to pass data using useNavigate?
You can pass your data with the path in form of state. The data we pass in state is in the form of key value pair as shown below
    navigate("path", { state: { num: id } });

And to receive the data we use useLocation hook
